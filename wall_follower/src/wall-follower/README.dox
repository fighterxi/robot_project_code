Project Description:
A robot developed using ROS that can navigate a maze based on the input from a laser range finder.

External Dependencies:
- ROS : v1.11.16 (Jade)
- OpenCV : v3.1.10
- GoogleTest : v1.7.0
- Doxygen : v1.8.11

Development timeline
- Sprint 1: Completed circle detection (Maria, Atabak), Completed random walk (Rubin),
  Basic wall following - a bit buggy (Rubin), Object detection without OpenCV using analytical methods - Experimental,
  not merged yet (Siddharth)

- Sprint 2: High Level Control (Rubin), Circle Detection (Atabak, Siddharth), HLC & CD Tests (Maria, Rubin, Siddharth), HLC & CD Docs (Maria), System tests (Atabak, Siddharth)

- Sprint 3: Code Modularization,Optimization and Cleanup(Rubin), Custom level based Logger(Atabak, Siddharth), Integration and Unit Tests(Atabak, Maria), High Level Control adjustments for real robot(Rubin), Code Documentation(Maria, Siddharth)

Setup:
- Navigate to your catkin workspace
- Run `cd src`
- Run `git clone https://github.com/JacobsUniversitySELab2016S/se-lab-team-7.git`
- Navigate back to your catkin workspace (`cd ../`)
- Run `catkin_make`
- Run `source devel/setup.bash` or `source devel/setup.zsh` or `source devel/setup.sh` depending on your shell
- Run `roslaunch robot simulator.launch world_name:=easy [--screen]`
- Run `roslaunch robot simulator.launch world_name:=medium [--screen]`
- Run `roslaunch robot simulator.launch world_name:=hard [--screen]`
- The --screen option serves to view the logging output on the screen

Tests:
- Navigate to your catkin workspace
- Run `catkin_make`
- Run `source devel/setup.bash` or `source devel/setup.zsh` or `source devel/setup.sh` depending on your shell
- Run `catkin_make run_tests` to execute test cases including system tests (i.e. individual levels)

Generate Documentation:
- Navigate to the git project root
- Run `doxygen Doxyfile` to generate documentation

Logger Usage:
- The Logger might be used in case logging levels are needed. Right now ROS_INFO is enough for our
  purposes.
- `Logger::Instance().Log("message", Logger::log_level_debug);`
- `Logger::Instance().Log("message", Logger::log_level_info);`
- `Logger::Instance().Log("message", Logger::log_level_error);`
